## Scenario

Imagine a new company, **“IQ Tech”**, has just reached out to you.

## Your Mission

**Step 1: Understand the Company Needs**

IQ Tech wants:

* A **homepage** with a hero section, products, and company highlights
* An **about page** introducing their team and mission
* A **contact page** with a form and company info

**Step 2: Create a Project Folder**

Name your project folder: `iq-website`

Inside, organize **folders and files** like a real developer:

* **HTML pages** (`index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`)
* **CSS folder** (`resources/css/`)

  * `main.css` for common styles
  * Optional theme folder: `resources/css/dark-theme/`
* **JavaScript folder** (`resources/js/`)

  * `main.js` for scripts
  * Optional page-specific JS: `contact.js` for form validation
* **Images folder** (`resources/images/`)

  * Company logo, hero images, products
* **Data folder** (`resources/data/`)

  * Optional: JSON or CSV for product listings
* **Vendors folder** (`vendors/`)

  * Optional: jQuery or plugins

**Step 3: Optional Fun Add-ons**

* Add a **fonts folder** for custom fonts
* Add a **media folder** for videos or background music
